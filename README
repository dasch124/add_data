# Astronomical Diaries Digital

This is the git repository for the data produced in the ADD project.

Currently it contains a very quick-and-dirty proof-of-concept conversion from ATF-JSON to TEI.

For developing purposes this is currently a 2-step process (which can be combined into one later on):

* *JSON to XML Transformation Scenario*: a XML representation of the JSON is produced using XQuery (`atf-json2tei.xquery`, stored to `101_derived`)
* *Convert to TEI*: The output of step 1 is transformed to TEI-XML via XSLT (`json-xml2tei.xsl`, stored to `102_derived_tei`)
